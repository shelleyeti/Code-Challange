# Instructions

Please write a function that parses the Preamble to the US Constitution (you can hard-code it as a string) and returns counts of how many words begin with 't', how many end with 'e', and how many both begin with 't' and end with 'e'. Please utilize C# to code your function. You can choose how to present your answer, but please deliver your solution on a web page utilizing basic HTML and CSS styling.
